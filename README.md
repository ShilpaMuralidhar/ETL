Team members:  Lisa Cannon, Shilpa Muralidhar
In this exercise, we will extract crash information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationâ€™s Fatality Analysis Reporting System (NHTSA-FARS) about fatal accidents that occurred in Texas in 2016.  There are 9,022 fatalities listed and 123 fields of information provided regarding the conditions and details of the traffic incident that resulted in fatality. The information extracted uses a number coding system to identify categories.  The number code is identified in a separate table.  The number code mapping tables of variables of interest will be obtained.
We will choose the fields of interest and convert their number codes into meaningful text information using the coding tables.  We would also like to provide the capability in an API to select a specific date range of fatal incidents.
